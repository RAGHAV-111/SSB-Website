                <p>PPDT: Also known as picture perception and discussion test. We have already talked so much about PPDT
                    earlier, this consists of story writing and group discussion. You will be shown a picture for 30
                    secs,
                    later you will have 3 minutes to write a story based on the picture shown, after that, you will be
                    divided into sub groups of 14-15 members, firstly each candidates will narrate his/her story which
                    is
                    followed by the group discussion on the picture, among the group members.

                <p>Psychological Test: It is a battery of projective tests, all tests are used to check the
                    psychological suitability of the candidate to be an officer. Candidates are required to write their
                    responses based on the particular test. Here the time limit is very crucial, so you are required to
                    write your first response in time. Assessment of an individual is done based on the entire written
                    tests & not in pieces, like a separate assessment of WAT, TAT & SRT. The personality of an
                    individual is one whole. The various inputs help to construct it.</p>

                <p>Personal Interview: It is the main key that decides your recommendation in the SSB Interview, SSB
                    Interview questions and answers play a vital role in the assessment of the candidate.In short, if
                    you go without preparation, you will cut short your chances of getting in. How to face
                    the IO[ Interviewing officer] in the SSB PI[ SSB Personal Interview] is the major concern here, one
                    wrong move can tarnish your image and reduce your chances to get recommended.</p>
